Steps to play the game:

use a while loop to
ask if they want to play again
and keep going until they
want to stop.

Then we need to write
play_one_game()

roll 2 dice:
and to get n 
check if n is 7 or 11 
  if it is you win
check if it is 2,3,12
  if it is you lose

roll again until you
get n (you win)
or 7 or 11 (you lose)



roll dice: 6 6 sum is 12
you lose ...
play again: yes

roll dice: 6 7 = 11
you win
play again: yes

roll dice: 4 6 = 10
roll dice: 3 3 = 6
roll dice: 6 5 = 11
